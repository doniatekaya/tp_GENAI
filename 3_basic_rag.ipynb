    "## Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain in Python. RAG systems combine information retrieval and natural language generation to produce answers that are grounded in external knowledge bases. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or datasets where direct querying isnâ€™t efficient or possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Learn how to use LangChain to implement a RAG system.\n",
    "- Implement the system step by step with guided TODO tasks.\n",
    "- Test your implementation at each step.\n",
    "- Provide helpful explanations and definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain: A library for building language model applications.\n",
    "- VectorStore (FAISS): A tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "- OpenAI Embeddings: Representations of text that can capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "- RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering over documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- I extracted some chapters of the Gen AI course as a txt file. \n",
    "- The goal how this notebook is to build a RAG system that can answer questions based on the content of these chapters."

      "Question: What's a Retrieval Augmented Generation?\n",
      "Answer: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based and generation-based models.  It enhances language models by giving them access to external knowledge or documents during generation. This allows the model to generate more accurate, up-to-date information by retrieving relevant data, rather than relying solely on its internal parameters, which reduces hallucinations.  RAG models are better at handling queries about recent events or specific information not present in their training data.\n",

      "Answer: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture primarily used in natural language processing.  They rely on a mechanism called self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data when processing it. Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers process data in parallel, making them significantly faster to train.  They have become the dominant architecture for large language models due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and capture complex relationships in text.\n",

      "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trains LLMs on human-written answers to follow instructions but is limited by data cost and potential hallucinations.  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) uses a reward model trained on human preferences to improve alignment, but faces challenges like answer length inflation and human disagreement.  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies RLHF by directly optimizing for human preferences.  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, improving factuality and reducing hallucinations.  Evaluation of RAG models is complex, often relying on LLM-based judges or metrics like precision and recall.\n",
